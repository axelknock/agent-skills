description: Generate a session reflection that lists each key task completed using <problem>, <solution>, and <result> blocks. Use when the user asks for a reflection, post-session recap, or a structured summary of completed work, and include updating AGENTS.md with process tips that would have made the work easier.

# Reflect

## Workflow

- Review the session and enumerate each key task that was completed.
- Output a reflection list where every task includes the following labeled blocks:
  - `<problem>`: brief statement of the task or challenge.
  - `<solution>`: concise description of how it was addressed.
  - `<result>`: concrete outcome or artifact produced.
- After the reflection, update `AGENTS.md` with any process notes, repo-specific guidance, or missing context that would have made the work significantly easier.
- Keep updates concise, actionable, and specific to this repository.
